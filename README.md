# LeetCode Notes

Welcome to my LeetCode Notes repository! This repository contains my solutions and detailed explanations for LeetCode problems. Each problem has its own folder with solutions in multiple programming languages, along with a README explaining the problem, approach, and complexity analysis.

## Problem List

Below is a list of problems solved in this repository (to be updated as problems are added):

- [Problem 1: Two Sum](P-1-two-sum)
- [Problem 9: Palindrome Number](P-9-palindrome-number)
- [Problem 13: Roman to Integer](P-13-roman-to-integer)
- _(Add more problems as they are solved)_

## Purpose

This repository serves as my personal learning journey through algorithmic problem-solving.

- Documenting my problem-solving journey on LeetCode.
- Exploring solutions in multiple programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++).
- Analyzing algorithms with detailed notes on time and space complexity.
- Sharing insights and approaches for others to learn from.

## Directory Structure

- Each problem is organized in a folder named `P-<number>-<name>` (e.g., `P-1-two-sum`).
- Inside each problem folder:
  - `README.md`: Problem description, approach, and complexity analysis.
  - `solution.<extension>`: Solution code in a specific programming language (e.g., `solution.py` for Python).
  - `tests/`: Optional test cases or scripts to validate solutions.
- The [templates](templates) folder contains reusable templates for problem READMEs and solution, tests files.
- The root `README.md` (this file) provides an overview of the repository.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to a problem folder (e.g., `P-1-two-sum`) to view the problem description and solutions.
2. Check the `README.md` in each problem folder for a detailed explanation of the approach and complexity.
3. Explore solutions in different languages (e.g., Python, Java) within each problem folder.
4. Use the `templates/` folder to create new problem folders with consistent formatting.

## Contributing

While this is primarily my personal learning repository, feel free to:

- Open issues for bugs or better solutions
- Suggest improvements to explanations
- Share alternative approaches
- Start discussions for fluid and open conversation
- Fix typos or formatting issues
- Add more templates for different languages or problem types
- Contribute additional test cases or examples
